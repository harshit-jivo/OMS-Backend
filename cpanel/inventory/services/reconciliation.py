"""Jivo Wellness ↔ Jivo Mart inter-company billing reconciliation.

Jivo Mart (JIVO_MART_HANADB) buys from Jivo Wellness (JIVO_OIL_HANADB — the SAP
company there is "JIVO WELLNESS PVT LTD"). The billing chain and its documents:

    MART (buyer)                         WELLNESS (seller)
    PO   (OPOR) ──(PO# = SO NumAtCard)──► SO   (ORDR)
    GRPO (OPDN)                           A/R Tax Invoice (OINV)
    A/P  (OPCH)                           [Delivery/Challan (ODLN) — usually skipped]

The cross-company join is the Mart PO number, which Wellness's billing team types
into the sales order's "Customer Ref. No." (ORDR.NumAtCard). Within each company the
documents chain natively by base-document references:
    Mart : PO ─(PDN1.BaseType=22)→ GRPO ─(PCH1.BaseType=20)→ A/P
    Well.: SO ─(INV1.BaseType=17)→ A/R Invoice   (Delivery, when used, sits between)

We reconcile the tax-inclusive total across PO / SO / GRPO / A/P / A/R. Amounts are
summed at LINE level via each line table's GTotal (gross incl. tax) — which equals the
document total — so partial fulfilment (one PO split across several GRPOs/invoices, or a
document that mixes several POs) is allocated to the right PO without double-counting.

A chain is:
    MATCHED     — all five amounts present and equal within the rupee tolerance
    MISMATCH    — all five present but they differ  (a real reconciliation problem)
    INCOMPLETE  — one or more downstream documents are missing (often just in-flight)
Only non-matched chains are "broken" and shown by default.
