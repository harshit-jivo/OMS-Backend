"""One shared cache in front of the three heavy SAP pulls.

The problem this solves
-----------------------
Building the navbar ticker asked SAP for the *same* data four times:

    get_total_sales_volume  -> get_sales_data(this month) + get_sales_data(last month)
    get_avg_realisation     -> get_sales_data(this month) + get_sales_data(last month)

Each of those calls REPORT_SALES_ANALYSIS, which takes 1.5 seconds. Four calls
= 6 seconds, for two distinct answers. The same thing happened with expenses
(operating expenses + salaries both pull get_expenses_by_category twice), and
the home page then repeated the whole lot a second time for its KPI cards.

What this module does
---------------------
It wraps those three functions. The wrappers have the SAME name, the SAME
arguments and return the SAME data - only now a repeat call within the cache
window is answered from memory instead of from SAP.

Three behaviours worth knowing:

1. Duplicate calls collapse. The four sales pulls become two.
2. Single flight. If ten requests arrive with a cold cache, one goes to SAP
   and the other nine wait for its answer, instead of ten stampeding SAP.
3. Serve stale, refresh behind. Once a value is older than its "fresh" window
   the old value is handed back immediately and a background thread fetches a
   new one. Nobody waits for a refresh.

Nothing here changes any SQL, any stored procedure, or any calculation. Every
caller gets a deep copy, so no caller can accidentally corrupt another's data.
