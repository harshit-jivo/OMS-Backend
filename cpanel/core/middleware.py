"""A stopwatch on every request.

Why this exists: when the control panel felt slow, nobody could say *which*
page was slow, or why. Every answer had to come from a one-off script. This
puts the measurement inside the app, permanently, so the question "what is
slow today?" is answered by reading a log instead of guessing.

For each request it records:

    2.31s  200  /realise/api/sales-data/   sap=1new+3reuse  sql=8  user=admin

  * how long the whole request took
  * how many brand-new SAP connections it needed (new ones are the expensive
    part - a healthy request should almost always show 0new)
  * how many pooled connections it reused
  * how many database queries it ran (a sudden jump here means an N+1 bug)

Only requests slower than SLOW_REQUEST_SECONDS are logged, so normal traffic
does not fill the disk. Set it to 0 to log everything while investigating.

Every response also carries an X-Response-Time header, so you can see the
number in your browser's Network tab without opening any log.
